<h2>WebShooter - Remotely screenshot any website!</h2>

All is include into one .php file, no special installation, can run on any php server.


<h3>How this program work?</h3>

Import a website locally through a local proxy for avoid same-origin policy limitations.<br>
Print full page canvas into your browser & save the result to server.<br>
By this way the image result take the browser size window, so you can arrange it just by resizing your browser!<br>

For use it, append your url into the shoot variable like the exemple do.<br>
Or paste an url into the main page text input.<br>
